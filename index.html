    Hi, my name is Daniella Rangel. The purpose of this is to tell you about myself. I have an undergrad in Speech and Hearing Pathology. I just finished a Project Management certification.

         Some of my favorite past times include gaming, playing bored games and rock hunting. Some of the best fossils that I have found come from the Jemez mountains, here in New Mexico. As much as I love playing video games, being outside is one of my favorite things to do. There are so many things to see in nature.

    <p3>I also have a super cute pomeranian named Yuki. </p3>
