    <p>Hi, my name is Daniella Rangel. The purpose of this is to tell you about myself. I have an undergrad in Speech and Hearing Pathology. I just finished a Project Management certification.</p>
    <p2> I spent the last three years as a resident DJ at Fabric in London while I was collaborating with Gabe Newell on Valve's latest VR technologies.</p2>
    <p3>Some of my favorite past times include gaming, playing bored games and rock hunting. Some of the best fossils
        that I have found come from the Jemez mountains, here in New Mexico. As much as I love playing video games,
        being outside is one of my favorite things to do. There are so many things to see in nature.
        I also have a super cute pomeranian named Yuki.  </p3>
    <p4>I recently won the POWERBALL, please don't tell anyone!</p4>
